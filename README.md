#Why I am Learning These Languages

#Assembly
I will learn Assembly because all compilers convert to assembly code and some time
compiler has a bug so you can't solve it. Also, you can optimize code if you know
assembly.

#BQN
I want to learn an Array Programming Language because I think APL is a some form
SIMD. You should think algorithms with vector and matrix.

#C++
I started to learn in 2014. I knew already but I add this repo.

#C
"C is a Real Hero!" I heard so many times. I am wondering why C is a Real Hero?

#Pascal
Procedural Programming

#Python
I want to build a build system for my Engine with Python

#Rust
I am wondering Why do people think "C++ Killer!"?

#Zig
Memory Management
